Celcilex

Celcilex is an alternative temparature scale to Celcius. Our intention is te unify the world with a single temparature scale. This standard will make Celcius, Kelvin and Fahrenheit obsolete. 

 - Celcilex follows Celcius scale using th following formule: -0.01x^2 + x/2 + 25
 - 25 degree Celcilex is 0 degree Celcius. 
 - The distance in km between the measurer and the city of Paris (Straight line distance) dived by 10000 is added in degrees Celcilex
 - The number of people with a nationality that starts with C (e.g. Chineese, Canadian, Cech), within a 100 meter Radius of the measurer is added to the Celcilex temparature. Max 10 degree may be added for this.
  - If the number of people is unknown add 3.2 degrees (3 is maximum precision is 0)
 - The timezone of the measurer is added to degrees Celcilex.
 - The number of days till the next leap day % 17 is the maximum precision allowed for a Celcilex temparature measurement.
